# Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler
### CWRU Coding Bootcamp

### Live demo: https://danashelton.github.io/TrainSchedule/

## Overview
In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## Technologies Used
Firebase Server
Javascript
jQuery
Moment.js
